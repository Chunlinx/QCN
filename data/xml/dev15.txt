Q2979_C3	maple syrup where can i find good quality maple syrup ? the particular recipe requires a good `` grade b '' maple syrup.im not sure what that is..help ?	re : maple syrup. you can find maple syrup in megamart , but it 's not cheap . i do n't know if it will be grade a or grade b , though . i *think* i 've even seen small bottles at carrefour . . .and ditto on the price . do n't worry too much about the grade a vs grade b. the grocery stores tend to sell grade a because consumers associate `` a '' with being superior to `` b '' . the grade b does have a slightly nicer flavor , but grade a will work just fine in your recipes . like someone else mentioned , we bring ours in from the u.s. because it 's much much less expensive . i think i brought at least three or four liters with me ! enjoy : o )

Q2980_C2	will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? ive been here to doha a month ago and i have a business visa . my employer is already processing my working visa . if ever i will resign and tranfer to another company , will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? what are the problems will i encounter ? please help .	re : will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ?. if ever you resign from your existing sponsor , you will require noc ( no objection certificate ) from your last sponsor to again get a visa . if you resign & exit qatar then for 2 years you can not get a work visa without the previous sponsors noc .
Q2980_C3	will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? ive been here to doha a month ago and i have a business visa . my employer is already processing my working visa . if ever i will resign and tranfer to another company , will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? what are the problems will i encounter ? please help .	re : will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ?. if you already have kama kalas you need noc to change sponsorshp and ths very dffcult becuse most of sponsorshps even f you fnshng contract duraton they dont lke to gve noc the mportant s f you ddnt go fnger scan no problem go home and change the passport and come by new vsa ( fnger prnt very mportant ) good luck

Q2980_C5	will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? ive been here to doha a month ago and i have a business visa . my employer is already processing my working visa . if ever i will resign and tranfer to another company , will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? what are the problems will i encounter ? please help .	re : will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ?. you said `` processing '' so it means you are not yet sponsored by your current employer . you can resign but bear in mind that you have a limited time to stay here for a business visa or else you have to pay the penalty when your visa expires . so if u will resign , make sure there is one position ready for you and willing to give sponsorship or even pay the penalty when your visa expires during processing . goodluck ! ! !
Q2980_C6	will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? ive been here to doha a month ago and i have a business visa . my employer is already processing my working visa . if ever i will resign and tranfer to another company , will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? what are the problems will i encounter ? please help .	re : will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ?. you have to do the following actions before you go for medical and fingerprint processes if you want to change the job , 1. resign from present job . 2. go back to your origin . 3. come back with new employer . you can not change job here itself , coz your sponsor is present employer . all the best
Q2980_C7	will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? ive been here to doha a month ago and i have a business visa . my employer is already processing my working visa . if ever i will resign and tranfer to another company , will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? what are the problems will i encounter ? please help .	re : will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ?. if your employer has paid for your coming to doha and your visa he will probably not look too kindly on your taking the opportunity to find another job . transferring your employment means an noc . if your sponsor has n't processed your rp but has paid for everything it would be immoral to use this loophole to skip on him . these kinds of shenanigans are the reason for the strict laws in qatar .
Q2980_C8	will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? ive been here to doha a month ago and i have a business visa . my employer is already processing my working visa . if ever i will resign and tranfer to another company , will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ? what are the problems will i encounter ? please help .	re : will i be ban ? or do i have to exit qatar ?. mandilulur , fyi my present company is trimming down their manpower everyday . most of my co-workers have been given their termination papers , after that they wo n't care about what happens to you . i do n't want to wait for my turn . i just want to know my options . our situations are not being considered in this case . i have no bad intentions towards my company but i 'm just looking after my livelihood and survival . thanks for your comments .

Q3040_C1	who is an expat ? hi all , i noticed that people selling their cars say that they are `` expat '' or `` expat car '' . well , what does that mean ? do `` expat cars '' bring more value than local folks ' cars . i know expat take care of their cars and spend money on it . but , really .. who is an expat . to me .. when i read the advert , i expect an native english speaker or europeans . is that so ? or expat is just everyone who is not local ?	in its broadest sense , an expatriate is any person living in a different country from where he or she is a citizen . in common usage , the term is often used in the context of professionals sent abroad by their companies , as opposed to locally hired staff ( who can also be foreigners ) . the differentiation found in common usage usually comes down to socio-economic factors , so skilled professionals working in another country are described as expatriates , whereas a manual labourer who has moved to another country to earn more money might be labelled an 'immigrant ' . wiki dixit !

Q3057_C2	parking ticket can someone tell me where can i go and pay a parking ticket i got near the city center mall ?	re : parking ticket. number 1. it must be by credit card . number 2. if there are no points associated with the ticket then you can pay on line . number 3. if there are points then you must go to one of the police stations ... al rayyan , madinat khalifa , airport traffic on tadmur and e ring or one of the kiosks at the airport and i think some of the malls . good luck on # 3 that may only be for cars that the sponsors own , if it is your personal vehicle and your qatar license is is tied to the vehicle then you may be able to pay on line . but company cars can not because they do n't know whom to assign the points to .
Q3057_C3	parking ticket can someone tell me where can i go and pay a parking ticket i got near the city center mall ?	re : parking ticket. parking tickets usually have points ( do n't ask me why , they just do ) . so you likely need pay in person . since you got it near city center , easiest would be the moi kiosk on the ground floor of cc , just under carrefour . bring your credit or debit card ( no cash ) and your drivers license .

Q3108_C1	to re-gift or not ? do you find it tacky or practical to recycle unused , unopened gifts and give them to other people ? i would really love to know your opinions about this matter . thanks .	i am a proud regifter ! !. you just have to be savvy enough to not regift the thing to the person who gave it to you initially . sounds easy enough , but when you 've been stashing things in your closet for 12 months , you kind of forget where and who they came from ! my theory is that it 's better those gifts go to someone else who might actually use and appreciate them than to sit unused in my spare bedroom for months on end . and my friends and i usually have a chinese gift exchange around the holidays , and that 's an absolutely perfect opportunity for everyone to get rid of those types of items . and some folks walk away really loving the new item they picked up ! `` most plain girls are virtuous because of the scarcity of opportunity to be otherwise .

( these are usually the ones that do not have lots of arabic and islamic studies on the curriculum . ) yes , a british passport does indeed come in handy , but so does a very big pile of cash . the better schools know that they are oversubscribed and so ( surprise , surprise ) they put up their fees accordingly . i have no problem at all with the idea of expat children learning arabic . i do , however , get very annoyed with the way that

'' i just came across this new posting today , amoud , and it does seem to suggest that getting a school place for your child is not as easy as you suggest . i am not an economist , but i do believe that there is something called , `` the law of supply and demand '' . if there is a shortage of something , the price goes up . this is what has happened ( and continues to happen ) in many schools
